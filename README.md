First I designed the interface, then I made it structured using HTML, then I styled it well using Talwindows and made the page responsive, then I added functionality to it using internal JavaScript, after doing all this I applied the SEO and integrated it with the help of JavaScript. After that when my landing page was complete, I created my repo on GitHub and then deployed it on Vercel.
